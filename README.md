## Welcome to JoinBase Community

## [Why you should use JoinBase](https://joinbase.io/)


## Download

From JoinBase 2023.2, the community edition is publicly available.

Get latest releases in the porject's [release page](https://github.com/open-joinbase/JoinBase/releases).

More [installation guide and prerequisites](https://joinbase.io/docs/references/install). 

JoinBase's community edition is provided under the [Commuity Edition License Agreement](https://joinbase.io/community_license): any people and company can use it free both for non-commercial and commercial purposes (including cloud services). 

The community edition has the same functions as the enterprise edition but without HA(High Availability) support. We crush competitors in the edge performance, if you don't require 100% HA, the community edition is enough, even for commercial services. 

## Release Notes

New version of the community edition is released in a time rhythm, and the version number of the community edition is based on that time rhythm. Currently the release cycle is one month.

It is recommended that users always use the latest release. Version compatibility will be maintained as much as possible. In JoinBase, the version compatibility means: users only need to simply replace the binary and restart to complete the upgrade. If one release is incompatible with the previous version, it will be declared in that release note and a solution will be provided.
